# Visual-Studio-CSharp
This repository will contain all of my C# projects.

## Projects:
 - [Car Insurance](https://github.com/BradySeme/Visual-Studio-CSharp/tree/master/CarInsurance)
 - [Shipping Quote](https://github.com/BradySeme/Visual-Studio-CSharp/tree/master/ShippingQuote)
 
 ### Car Insurance
 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that aloows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
 
 ### Shipping Quote
 This project was a console application that would ask a user to input the dimensions and weight of their package. Then the application would calculate whether the package is to big or heavy to ship and display it back to the user.
